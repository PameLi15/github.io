	<font color="#3C7A93">Set of techniques that allow building general programmable logic machines in a practical way. In terms of terminology, the "architecture" of a computer is distinguished from the "organization" of a computer.

<center>The implementation of instructions is similar to the use of an assembly series in a manufacturing factory. In assembly lines, the product goes through many stages of production before having the product assembled. Each stage or segment of the chain is specialized in a specific area of ​​the production line and always carries out the same activity. This technology is applied in the design of efficient processors.
These processors are known as pipeline processors. These are composed of a list of linear and sequential segments where each segment carries out a task or a group of computational tasks. The data that comes from abroad is entered into the system to be processed. The computer performs operations with the data it has stored in memory, produces new data or information for external use.
The architectures and instruction sets can be classified considering the following aspects:
Operand storage in the CPU: where the operators are located apart from the informative subtractor.
Number of Explicit Operands per Instruction: How many operands are expressed explicitly in a typical instruction. They are usually 0, 1, 2, and 3.

Operand position: can any operand be in memory, or must some or all be in the internal registers of the CPU? How the memory address is specified (available addressing modes).
Operations: What operations are available in the instruction set.
Type and size of operands and how they are specified.</center>

They are in charge of processing the logic of the system instructions. There are seven different basic types:

<center><font color="0404F3"><h3>NOT:</h3></font></center> is the denial of input. It works with a single input and a single output.

<center><img src="NOT.JPG"></center>

<center><font color="0404F3"><h4>AND:</h4></font></center> is the binary multiplication of two inputs and gives a single output.

<center><img src="AND.JPG"></center>

<center><font color="0404F3"><h5>OR:</h5></font></center> is the binary sum of two inputs and outputs the proper sum or the carry bit if necessary.

<center><img src="OR.PNG"></center>

<center><font color="0404F3"><h6>XOR:</h6></font></center> is the binary sum of two inputs and gives the result as output, not including the carry bit.

<center><img src="XOR.PNG"></center>

<center><font color="0404F3"><h7>NAND:</h7></font></center> is the negation of AND. It gives a single exit.

<center><font color="0404F3"><h8>NOR:</h8></font></center> is the negation of OR. It gives a single output.

<center><img src="NOR.PNG"></center>

<center><font color="0404F3"><h9>XNOR:</h9></font></center> is the negation of XOR. It gives a single output

<center><font color="E28FF8"><h11>What are they?</h11></font></center>

<center>
A microcontroller is an integrated circuit that contains all the components of a computer. It is used to control the operation of a certain task and, due to its small size, it is usually incorporated into the device itself that it governs.</center>

<center><font color="FEAF13">Where does the use of microcontrollers apply?</font></center>

<center>Microcontrollers are being used in a multitude of systems present in daily life, such as toys, microwave ovens, refrigerators, televisions, computers, printers, modems, the starting system of our car, etc.

<center><font color="C913FE"><h12>Memory Address</h12></font></center>

<center>Memory address. A memory address is an identifier for a memory location with which a computer program or hardware device can store data for later reuse. A common way to describe a computer's main memory is as a collection of cells that store data and instructions. Each cell is identified by a number or memory address. The information that is stored in each cell is a byte that is a set of eight bits, these bits represent the minimum storage unit for data and instructions, since a bit can only contain the value zero or one and that is not enough to save data or instructions, so it must be stored in bytes.</center>
